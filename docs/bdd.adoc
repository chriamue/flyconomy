== Behaviour Driven Development in Our Project

Our project uses Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) for a portion of its testing suite.
In this document, we will cover how these tests are organized and how they can be run.

=== File Structure

BDD test files are located within the `tests/` directory at the root of the project.

----
.
├── bdd_tests.rs
├── features
│   └── simulation.feature
└── steps
    └── mod.rs
----

`bdd_tests.rs` is the main entry point of the tests and it configures the tests' world state. The `features` directory contains `.feature` files that describe the individual test cases using Gherkin syntax. These scenarios are made up of steps, which are defined in `steps/mod.rs`.

=== Running the Tests

You can run BDD tests with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
cargo test --features bdd --test bdd_tests
----

This command will compile the test runner and execute all the defined BDD tests.

=== Understanding the Test Structure

Each feature file contains a set of scenarios. Each scenario represents a behavior we want to test.

For instance, a simple scenario in the `simulation.feature` file might look like this:

[source,gherkin]
----
Feature: Checking simulation properties

  Scenario: Running the simulation until timestamp 1000
    Given the simulation is at timestamp 1000
    Then the simulation timestamp should be less than 1001
----

The steps in the scenario, (i.e., the lines starting with `Given`, `When`, `Then`, and `And`), are matched with step definition functions in the `steps/mod.rs` file.

For example, the "the simulation is at timestamp 0" step might be matched with a step definition function that checks the timestamp of the simulation and the "the simulation should be in the default state" step might be matched with a step definition function that checks if the simulation's state matches its expected default state.
