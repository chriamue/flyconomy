## Web3 Integration for Attractions: NFTs üåê

Flyconomy goes beyond traditional gaming by integrating Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for attractions. This allows players to truly own, update, and transfer parts of the game world.

### How does it work?

1. **NFTs as Attractions**: Each attraction in Flyconomy is represented as an NFT. Owning an NFT gives you the right to update its name, description, and GPS location.
2. **Minting New Attractions**: Players can mint new attractions up to a total of 1000. This means you can create and add your own landmarks to the game, making it a truly community-driven experience.
3. **Transferring Ownership**: After the initial 1000 attractions are minted, you'll need to acquire a token from another player to update an attraction. This ensures that the game world remains dynamic, with attractions potentially changing based on player trades and decisions.
